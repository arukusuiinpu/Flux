## Mock plans:
- More useful operators and aliases (Python, C#)
- := operator
- Better generics (C# inspired; includes single function parametrization for 2+ types)
- Non-finalized or dynamic lambdas
- Inherited libraries (built-in or 'no import' libraries are defined using metadata)
- Powerful annotation (dynamically derived values in interfaces for example)
- A custom 'plug-and-code' Java compiler (via a built-in Maven)
- Realtime bytecode modifications
- Built-in mixin-like functionality
- C# realtime compilation and execution support\

_Sorted based on plausibility of quick implementation and urgency._
